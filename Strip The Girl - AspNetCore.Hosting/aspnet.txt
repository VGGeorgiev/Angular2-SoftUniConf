Kestrel - Is the thing that accepts a http request from the network, turns into httpcontext, parses it through the application middleware pipeline. Knows how to bind to a port and listen for network traffic and translate this traffic to something that the rest of the stack can listen to.

WebListener - Same as Kestrel, but Windows only (WebListener will be removed when Kestrel can do everything that WL can)

1. Hosting
	- Why we need this?
	- Configuration needed
	- Kestrel
2. Hosting Structure
3. Debugging the code


A host must implement the IWebHost interface, which exposes collections of features and services, and a Start method. The host is typically created using an instance of a WebHostBuilder, which builds and returns a WebHost instance.

IWebHost - Collection of features and services and Start method.
WebHostBuilder - Builds and returns a WebHost instance.

Plan for the demo:
	1. Configurations
		UseStartUp
			WebHostBuilderExtenssions
				show all startup methods
					ConventionBasedStartup : IStartUp
						StartUpLoader
						StartupMethods
						ConfigureBuilder
						ConfigureServicesBuilder
				show Configure
	2. WebHostBuilder methods

			HostingEnvironment
			WebHostOptions
		ConfigureServices
		ConfigureLogging
		UseLoggerFactory
		UseSettings, GetSettings
	3. WebHostBuilder Build
		BuildHostingServices
			WebHostOptions
			HostingEnvironment - Initialize
			ApplicationBuilderFactory
			AutoRequestServicesStartupFilter
				RequestServicesContainerMiddleware
					RequestServicesFeature
			StartupLoader
	4. WebHost

			ApplicationLifetime
		Run
			ApplicationLifetime
		Start
			Initialize -> BuildApplication
